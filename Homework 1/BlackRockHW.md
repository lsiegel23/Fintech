What makes BlackRock different than other companies in the same space is their sheer size. They are so large and offer so many different products and services it overwhelms their competitors. The unfair advantage comes into play when busineses need to offer benefits to their employees BlackRock is able to offer such a variety of investment products they can handle the lowest level employee all the way to the CEO. With their new focus on retirement they will only grow their corporate partnerships and be able to grow at a rate unlike its competition.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    It is very difficult to think of a product or service that BlackRock doesn't currently use to improve their company. The only industry I can think of that they should move in to is personal and corporate banking. If they decided to move into the online banking sector they would be able to grow exponetially because they amount of funds they'd be able to invest and grow would be astronomical, especially with the success they've already had. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    This would benefit the company because they could capture a younger demographic and keep customer loyalty for another 60 plus years. In order to make banking easy for Generation Z they would be able to make sure that they are not only at the forefront of asset management but also finacial technological services. It would be a massive investment but worthwhile.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    There are a lot of technologies that they could use. Online banking would require a brand new application that would definitely put a strain on their network. They would need to invest in an updated network infrastructure. In terms of other products and services it seems as if BlackRock would want to stay within their Aladdin software. In order to do so they should take part of their developer team and work on a banking application that is easy to use and visually appealing. Using Blockchain technology within the Aladdin software could insure that the app is safe for consumers to use as well. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    These technologies are appropriate because BlackRock really trusts their own system. They would need to create a safe and easy way to make sure the average consumer would trust and be able to use their app.
